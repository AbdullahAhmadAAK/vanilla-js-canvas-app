**Intro**

All you need to know about this repo, will be written in [**this article**](https://abdullahaak06.medium.com/tutorial-drawable-and-pannable-zoomable-canvas-in-vanilla-js-0f9e6acd35df).

Just open the HTML file with live server, and watch the magic unfold ;)

**Description**

This is a customized canvas tool, built as an exploration into the possibilities available for me with vanilla JS. I enjoyed myself thoroughly.

**Story:**

A client needed a very customized canvas tool in his app. I was stuck between several canvas drawing libraries. Some provide the freehand tool feature, but not the panning and the zooming, Some provided the panning and the zooming, but not the drawing of shapes. Some didn't provide the pen width.

After reviewing the options I had, I decided to go with vanilla JS and test whether what I needed to build was even possible. I truly enjoyed this process, and have Harrsion Milbradt to thank. The inspiration for this comes from his two articles, from which I combined the knowledge and added some extra to present this solution. Hoping this is useful for anyone who wants to take a look at how canvases are implemented in JS.

Feel free to reach out for any issues you may have understanding this. I would love to help anyone, the way Harrison helped me with his knowledge.

How the end result looked like (it was still in progress, but the core functionality had been implemented in the SvelteKit app):
